# advent-of-code-2023

This is my setup for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Perhaps unsurprisingly, I will be coding
in Go this year.

A convenient template is provided by the Nix flake located in the repository root. Simply create the day the challenge is
for and run `nix flake init -t ..` inside the directory. Add a package to the flake.nix as you see fit.
